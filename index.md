### Week 8

The PN532 was wired by following the Breadboard View image found in Week 7. The following were wired from the RPI to the PN532:VCC,GND,SDA and SCL (for I2C). Upon startup and with some configurations, the PN532 was picked up by RPI using I2C. The project is currently in track to be completed.

Some standoffs,scews and nuts were recently purchased. The budget is on track and available for any other purchases.

Here is the overview of the wired breadboard and tested output.

### Week 7
Version 1 of PCB has been designed. May need to make some adjustments later on. 

Nothing else has been purchased, but do plan on purchasing standoffs and additional components. The NFC breakout board has been soldered and powered out for testing.

Here is the Breadboard view:
